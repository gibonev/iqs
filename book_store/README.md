# Instructions

## Base
I have a bookstore that stores all my books in a csv file. I would like to

1. Exclude all the books that were published before 2000.
2. I would like them to be grouped by authors
3. The output should be in json format. It should match ```expected_output.json``` (order inside the list irrelevant)

## Extension
If the candidates completes it in less than 40min, then some extended questions to ask depending on the time left.

1. What will you do differently if the bookstore is large (e.g. more than 1 million rows)? How can you improve its
   performance
2. Could you wrap this into a module, so it can be called via python -m which takes input and output filenames
3. How would write a unit test for this?
