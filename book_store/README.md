# Instructions

## Base
A bookstore stores all of their inventory in a `inventory.csv` file. They would like to

1. Exclude all books that were published before 2000.
2. Group them by author.
3. The output should be in json format. It should match `expected_output.json` (order is irrelevant)

## Extra Credit

1. What will you do differently if the bookstore is large (e.g. more than 1 million rows)? How can you improve its
   performance?
2. Could you make this script executable where it takes inventory and output filenames as command line arguments?
3. How would write a unit test for this?
