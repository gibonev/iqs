# Instructions

## Base
A bookstore stores all of their inventory in a csv file. They would like to

1. Exclude all books that were published before 2000.
2. Group them by author.
3. The output should be in json format. It should match ```expected_output.json``` (order is irrelevant)

## Extra Credit

1. What will you do differently if the bookstore is large (e.g. more than 1 million rows)? How can you improve its
   performance?
2. Could you wrap this into a module, so it can be called via python -m which takes input and output filenames?
3. How would write a unit test for this?
